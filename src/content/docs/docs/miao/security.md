## Before you report

This is a small project. It has had no security report yet, so there is no queue
to join and no backlog to fight through. Two things are asked of a report, and
neither is about volume:

- **Reproduce it.** Say what you did, what you expected, what happened instead,
  and on which version. A report someone can follow is a report someone can fix.
- **Send it because you checked, not because a tool said so.** Scanner output
  pasted in unreviewed, or a report written by a model that nobody ran, is not
  yet a report. If a model drafted it, verify the claim against the code
  yourself and send what you verified.

A report that does this gets read properly. One that does not may be closed with
a pointer back to this section.

## Threat Model

### Overview

Miao is an AI-powered coding assistant that runs locally on your machine. It provides an agent system with access to powerful tools including shell execution, file operations, and web access.

### Sandboxing

By default, Miao does **not** sandbox the agent. The permission system exists as a UX feature to help users stay aware of what actions the agent is taking - it prompts for confirmation before executing commands, writing files, etc. However, it is not designed to provide security isolation.

There is also an **opt-in kernel sandbox** for the V2 `bash` tool, which is off unless enabled. It builds a seatbelt profile for `sandbox-exec` on macOS and applies Landlock on Linux; `miao-sandbox` reports no backend on Windows.

```jsonc
{ "sandbox": { "mode": "workspace-write", "network": true } }
```

`MIAO_SANDBOX=1` and `MIAO_SANDBOX_DENY_NETWORK=1` override the configuration. Three properties of it belong in a threat model:

- **It is off unless the user turns it on.** `mode` defaults to `"off"`.
- **It fails open.** If a sandbox is requested but no backend is available, `on_unavailable` defaults to `"warn"` and the command runs **unsandboxed**. Set it to `"fail"` to refuse instead.
- **`workspace-write` restricts writes, not reads.** Writes are limited to the active Location, the command's working directory, temp directories, `writable_roots` and paths approved after a blocked write (the command is then rerun with the directory added). Network is allowed unless denied.

If you need true isolation, run Miao inside a Docker container or VM.

### Server Mode

Server mode is opt-in: it starts with `miao serve`, or `miao remote` for the chat bridges, and is not running otherwise.

The service listens on **127.0.0.1 only** and does not advertise itself over mDNS, so it is reachable from this machine rather than from the network.

Authentication is HTTP Basic Auth, turned on by setting `MIAO_SERVER_PASSWORD`. Without it the service still starts, and says so itself:

> MIAO_SERVER_PASSWORD 没有设置，本机其它进程可以不经鉴权访问 127.0.0.1 上的服务

That is the exposure to weigh: not a remote attacker, but any other process on your machine. An unauthenticated instance is local-only by construction; set the password when local-only is not good enough. Because the service is opt-in and loopback-bound by design, its behaviour in that configuration is not a vulnerability.

### Out of Scope

| Category                        | Rationale                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Server access when opted-in** | If you enable server mode, API access is expected behavior               |
| **Permission-system escapes**   | That system is not a sandbox (see above). The kernel sandbox is separate |
| **Requested sandbox gap**       | Documented: `on_unavailable` defaults to `"warn"`. Set it to `"fail"`    |
| **LLM provider data handling**  | Data sent to your configured LLM provider is governed by their policies  |
| **MCP server behavior**         | External MCP servers you configure are outside our trust boundary        |
| **Malicious config files**      | Users control their own config; modifying it is not an attack vector     |

# Reporting Security Issues

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/oxdingzg/miao/security/advisories/new) tab.

You will get a reply saying what happens next, and after that, how the fix is
going. There is no security team here and no guaranteed response time: if you
have heard nothing after a week, follow up on the same thread.
