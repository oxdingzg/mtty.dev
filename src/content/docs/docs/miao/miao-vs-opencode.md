miao builds on opencode's open-source coding workflow and invests in context efficiency, session control, and measurable operating cost. This page describes the fork's engineering work and its recorded baseline measurements. It is **not an audit of the current upstream product**, and shared capabilities such as model selection, MCP, and subagents are not claimed as exclusive to miao.

## What changes the daily workflow

| Area                      | miao's implementation                                                                        | Practical value                                                             | Availability                         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Input during execution    | Durable admission; steer at safe provider-turn boundaries; explicit queue at idle boundaries | Add constraints while work continues, with a recorded pending input         | V2                                   |
| Session collaboration     | `task`, resumable child sessions, project-scoped `list_sessions` / `send_message`            | Delegate focused work and exchange findings across conversations            | V2; messaging subject to permissions |
| Context stability         | Immutable Context Epoch baseline; chronological context updates                              | Reduce unnecessary changes to a reusable provider-cache prefix              | V2                                   |
| Cost and cache visibility | Per-turn usage, estimated cost, TTFT, cache-hit ratio and cache-state classification         | Diagnose expensive or slow turns with measurements                          | Implemented                          |
| Context controls          | Output bounding, optional pruning, compaction settings and cache TTL                         | Keep large tool results and long histories from consuming context unchecked | V2; advanced settings opt-in         |
| Long-task continuation    | Todo-driven loop with iteration / stall guards and optional cost budget                      | Continue multi-step work without a new prompt after every idle boundary     | V2, opt-in                           |
| Durable history           | Stored inbox and event-backed history; fork and export                                       | Keep inspectable conversations beyond a terminal's lifetime                 | V2; no automatic crash continuation  |
| Independent distribution  | Own release source and versioning; separate release, source, and preview commands            | Validate development builds while keeping the daily command usable          | Implemented                          |

Estimated costs depend on configured model rates and currency metadata. Budget checks stop further scheduling once the threshold is reached; they do not cap a request already in flight or replace provider billing. Prompt caching depends on the provider and workload, so there is no guaranteed task-level savings percentage.

## Recorded native benchmarks

The baseline is this repository's TypeScript implementation before the native work, not today's `anomalyco/opencode`. These are recorded same-machine release-build medians for isolated operations through the Rust addon. They exclude shared orchestration, I/O, LSP, formatting, provider latency, and model reasoning. They have not been re-run as part of this documentation update.

| Operation                                         | TypeScript baseline | Rust native | Speedup   | Integration scope      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| edit exact match (12k lines)                      | 0.21 ms             | 0.12 ms     | **1.7x**  | Compatibility path     |
| edit fuzzy match (12k lines)                      | 0.76 ms             | 0.39 ms     | **1.9x**  | Compatibility path     |
| edit match + diff stats (12k lines)               | 2.03 ms             | 1.78 ms     | 1.14x     | Compatibility path     |
| apply_patch `deriveNewContents` exact (20k lines) | 1.67 ms             | 1.28 ms     | **1.3x**  | Compatibility path     |
| apply_patch trim match (20k lines)                | 3.47 ms             | 1.76 ms     | **2.0x**  | Compatibility path     |
| apply_patch unicode-normalize (20k lines)         | 13.06 ms            | 5.21 ms     | **2.5x**  | Compatibility path     |
| git status small repo (10 files / 2 changes)      | 12.3 ms             | 1.0 ms      | **11.9x** | Prototype; not default |
| git status large repo (2200 files / 400 changes)  | 13.6 ms             | 5.8 ms      | **2.4x**  | Prototype; not default |

CPU-heavy matching and normalization show the clearest gains. In-process Git avoids subprocess startup overhead in the prototype. Neither result establishes an end-to-end coding-task speedup.

## Native tools and sandbox: where they apply

The current code has two tool implementations. Native integration lives in `packages/miao/src/tool`; the default V2 runner uses the separate leaves in `packages/core/src/tool`.

- **Compatibility edit / patch:** use the native addon where available, with a TypeScript fallback; `MIAO_NATIVE=0` disables it. This is not a claim that V2 edits use the addon.
- **In-process Git:** the `gix` implementation and benchmarks exist, but it is not the default Git path.
- **Compatibility shell sandbox:** opt in with `MIAO_SANDBOX=1`. macOS seatbelt and Linux Landlock restrict writes; network is allowed in the shell integration unless `MIAO_SANDBOX_DENY_NETWORK=1` is also set. Availability depends on the platform and packaged backend.
- **V2 permissions:** rule-based approvals remain the relevant default control. V2's `bash` leaf does not currently route through the compatibility sandbox. An environment flag alone does not provide V2 kernel confinement.

For compatibility TUI testing, `MIAO_TUI_V2=0` selects V1. Read the [guide](/docs/miao/guide/#56-kernel-level-sandbox-compatibility-runtime-opt-in) and [integration risks](https://github.com/oxdingzg/miao/blob/a98f5ce4354f8abfda8412e5579cb78a205538c8/docs/rust-integration-risks.en.md) before relying on the sandbox. Windows kernel sandbox parity is not implemented.

## Boundaries and ongoing work

- V2 is the default TUI runtime; V1 retirement remains in progress.
- Durable history and exact prompt retry reconciliation do not mean automatic recovery of interrupted provider execution or exactly-once shell side effects.
- Session execution and messaging wakes remain process-local; no cross-machine agent cluster is advertised.
- Code Mode is experimental. Generated clients and the embedded host are private workspace packages with evolving contracts.
- Per-target messaging policy persistence and receiving-drain loop accounting still have open design work; see [session messaging](https://github.com/oxdingzg/miao/blob/a98f5ce4354f8abfda8412e5579cb78a205538c8/specs/v2/session-messaging.md).

See [README](https://github.com/oxdingzg/miao/blob/a98f5ce4354f8abfda8412e5579cb78a205538c8/README.md) for the product overview, [the guide](/docs/miao/guide/) for usage, and [CONTEXT.md](https://github.com/oxdingzg/miao/blob/a98f5ce4354f8abfda8412e5579cb78a205538c8/CONTEXT.md) for runtime contracts.
