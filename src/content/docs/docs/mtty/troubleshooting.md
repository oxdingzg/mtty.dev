## The build fails, or the first build takes minutes

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Rust | The **stable** toolchain, pinned in [`rust-toolchain.toml`](https://github.com/oxdingzg/miao-term/blob/4270da6190eb766c24011cd998d5c4d7ac755291/rust-toolchain.toml); MSRV 1.80 |
| GPU | A driver supporting Metal (macOS), Vulkan (Linux) or DX12 (Windows) |
| Linux | The usual `winit`/`wgpu` system libraries (X11 or Wayland development packages) |

The first build compiles `wgpu` and `glyphon` and may take a few minutes. Later
builds are incremental.

## macOS says the app is from an unidentified developer

`scripts/package-macos.sh` produces an **ad-hoc signed** bundle. Release
packages carry a Developer ID signature and notarization only when the optional
signing secrets are configured in the release workflow, and Windows MSI signing
is in the same position. Until then, macOS asks for confirmation the first time
the app is opened; the standard path is System Settings → Privacy & Security →
"Open Anyway".

You can check which build you have:

```sh
mtty --version     # prints "mtty <version> (native)"
```

## My configuration is not being read

Configuration is one file:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| Linux / macOS | `~/.config/mtty/config.toml`, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mtty/config.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\mtty\config.toml` |

Two specific traps:

- **Windows under Git Bash.** A `~/.config/mtty` that already exists under the
  `HOME` Git Bash sets keeps being used, rather than `%APPDATA%`.
- **Coming from miaotty.** On first start, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/miaotty` is copied
  to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mtty` when the latter does not exist. The old directory
  is kept, so editing it changes nothing. Move your edits to the new path.

If no mtty configuration exists at all, ghostty's `config` and alacritty's
`alacritty.toml` are imported automatically — so a setting may be coming from
there. See [configuration](/docs/mtty/config/).

## A pane does not report its directory or history

That is the shell shim, which loads your own startup files first and never
modifies them:

| Shell | How the shim is loaded |
|---|---|
| zsh | a `ZDOTDIR` whose `.zshenv` restores the real `ZDOTDIR` |
| bash | `--rcfile` sourcing `~/.bashrc`; `PS0` on bash 4.4+, a DEBUG trap on older bash (macOS 3.2) |
| fish | a `vendor_conf.d` script reached through `XDG_DATA_DIRS` |
| PowerShell | `-NoExit -Command` after the profile; PSReadLine history needs PowerShell 7 |

A startup file that resets `ZDOTDIR`, `XDG_DATA_DIRS` or `PS0` after the shim
has run will break the report. The shims are tested end to end in a real PTY
for zsh, bash 3.2/5.x, fish 3.7 and PowerShell 7.5 on Linux, and for Windows
PowerShell in CI.

## Restoring a session does not bring back what was running

Restoring replays the **layout** and starts new shells; running processes are
not preserved. To keep shells alive across a restart, set:

```toml
pty-host = true      # experimental
```

## `mtty-cli` cannot connect

| Check | Detail |
|---|---|
| Socket | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/mtty.sock`, falling back to `$TMPDIR`; pass `--socket PATH` or set `MTTY_SOCKET` to override |
| Older clients | `miaotty.sock` is linked to `mtty.sock`, and `mtty-cli` falls back to an older host's socket or pipe |
| Remote TCP | `remote-listen` refuses to start without `MTTY_MTP_TOKEN`, and every request must then carry it |
| Capabilities | `MTTY_MTP_ALLOW` rejects anything outside the allowlist with `forbidden` |

`mtty-cli ping` reports the capabilities the host actually allows, in
`allowed`. See [the control plane](/docs/mtty/cli/).

## Launching the app again does nothing

That is deliberate: a second launch forwards to the running instance through
the existing control socket, rather than starting a second process. Use
`⌘⇧T` / `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+T` (Quick Terminal) or a new tab for another terminal.

## Links, and upgrading from miaotty

| What | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| URL schemes | macOS and Linux register `mtty://`, `ssh://` and `x-man-page://`; the Windows MSI registers only `mtty://` |
| `mtty://` vs `miaotty://` | Both open mtty |
| Agent hooks | Installed hook scripts and miao's integration read `MIAOTTY_PANE_ID` / `MIAOTTY_CLI`, which are still exported, so they keep reporting state; newly installed hooks use the `MTTY_*` names |
| Notifications on macOS | The rename changed the bundle ID, so macOS asks for notification permission again |

See [identity and migration](https://github.com/oxdingzg/miao-term/blob/4270da6190eb766c24011cd998d5c4d7ac755291/docs/APP-IDENTITY.md) for the full table.

## The editor has no completions, diagnostics or hover

The editor pane starts a language server for `rust-analyzer`,
`typescript-language-server`, `pyright-langserver`, `gopls` or `clangd` when it
is on the **login shell's** `PATH`. Two things to check:

- The server is not installed, or is not on the login shell's `PATH` — the app
  does not read a shell's interactive aliases.
- The file is over 2 MB, which gets no language server.

An explicit `[lsp] enabled = false` disables the lot. See
[configuration](/docs/mtty/config/).

## Nothing here matches what I see

The rest of the documentation is in the repository: [installation](/docs/mtty/install/),
[view rules](/docs/mtty/view-rules/), and the annotated
[`config.example.toml`](https://github.com/oxdingzg/miao-term/blob/4270da6190eb766c24011cd998d5c4d7ac755291/docs/config.example.toml). For anything else, open an issue
on [oxdingzg/miao-term](https://github.com/oxdingzg/miao-term/issues), or write
to <contact@mtty.dev>.
